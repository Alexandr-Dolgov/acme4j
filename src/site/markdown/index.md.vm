acme4j
======

A Java client for the _Automatic Certificate Management Environment_ (ACME) protocol.

ACME is a protocol that a certificate authority (CA) and an applicant can use to automate the process of verification and certificate issuance.

This Java client helps connecting to an ACME server, and performing all necessary steps to manage certificates.

It is an independent open source implementation that is not affiliated with or endorsed by _Let's Encrypt_.

Quick Start
-----------

_acme4j_ is available at Maven Central. Just add this snippet to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
  <artifactId>${project.artifactId}-client</artifactId>
  <version>${project.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

For Gradle:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile '${project.groupId}:${project.artifactId}-client:${project.version}'
}
```

There is also an optional utility module that will help you handling key pairs and certificates (but requires [Bouncy Castle](https://www.bouncycastle.org/java.html)):

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
  <artifactId>${project.artifactId}-utils</artifactId>
  <version>${project.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

For Gradle:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile '${project.groupId}:${project.artifactId}-utils:${project.version}'
}
```

Now just have a look at [this source code](./acme4j-example/apidocs/src-html/org/shredzone/acme4j/ClientTest.html) to see an example usage.
