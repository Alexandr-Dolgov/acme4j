acme4j
======

A Java client for the _Automatic Certificate Management Environment_ (ACME) protocol.

ACME is a protocol that a certificate authority (CA) and an applicant can use to automate the process of verification and certificate issuance.

This Java client helps connecting to an ACME server, and performing all necessary steps to manage certificates.

It is an independent open source implementation that is not affiliated with or endorsed by _Let's Encrypt_.

The source code can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/shred/acme4j) and is distributed under the terms of [Apache License 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

Quick Start
-----------

_acme4j_ is available at Maven Central. Just add this snippet to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
  <artifactId>${project.artifactId}-client</artifactId>
  <version>${project.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

There is also an optional utility module that will help you handling key pairs and certificates (but requires [Bouncy Castle](https://www.bouncycastle.org/java.html)):

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
  <artifactId>${project.artifactId}-utils</artifactId>
  <version>${project.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

Now just have a look at [this source code](https://github.com/shred/acme4j/blob/master/acme4j-example/src/main/java/org/shredzone/acme4j/ClientTest.java) to see an example usage.

Running Integration Tests
-------------------------

_acme4j-client_ contains a number of integration tests. These tests are _not_ executed by maven by default, as they require a [Pebble ACME test server](https://github.com/letsencrypt/pebble).

To run them, install and run a Pebble server instance on your build machine. Then invoke maven with the `-DskipITs=false` option set, to enable the integration tests at `verify` phase.

If you are running a Pebble server on a different host and/or port, invoke maven with the `pebbleHost` and `pebblePort` system properties set to the appropriate host and port, respectively. For example, to connect to `acme.example.com` port 12345, use `-DpebbleHost=acme.example.com -DpebblePort=12345`.
